# Extended Position Based Dynamics
This project is my attempt to implement a general purpose physics-engine.
It is written in C++ and OpenGl is used for visualisation.

## Current Features:
- Basic gameloop
- Opengl renderer for primitives
#### Solver:
- Basic constraints
- Constraint managers
- Spacial hashigrid for collision detection (slower than without)

## Planned Features include:
- Fluid dynamics using SPH kernel functions
- Rigidbodies
- Softbodies
- Coupeling between different objects (fluid and rigid bodies for example)
